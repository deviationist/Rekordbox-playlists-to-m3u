# Rekordbox Playlists to M3U
This project is a CLI-tool that will convert your Rekordbox XML-export to individual M3U-files that you can import to for example Traktor.

## Getting started
Run `npm ci`, then place the Rekordbox XML-fil (filename "rekordbox.xml") in the root folder of this project, then run `npm run convert`. After a successful conversion the M3U-files should be located in a folder called "Playlists".
